This is the repository implementing the computational framework used in the manuscript entitled "Controlling human causal inference through in-silico task design".

There are two folders - the one 'task-controller' folder contains the implementation of the task controller proposed in the manuscript, and the other 'analysis' contains all the scripts to analyse the participants' behaviour. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the lead contact upon reasonable request.
